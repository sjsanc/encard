# Encard

A TUI for flashcards that uses the filesystem for card storage.

I enjoy writing cards more than I do memorising facts (surprise, surprise). By storing cards as plain text, the friction for creating cards is reduced.

In its current form, it's a clone of [hascard](https://github.com/Yvee1/hascard?tab=readme-ov-file) except written in Go.
